Initially under the name of "Cora Apps" and later "Coora", this was a joint venture of mine with user interface designer [Mikael Carrara](https://github.com/mikaelcarrara).

We developed several products for Web, Palm/HP WebOS, Android, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browser extensions.

We had the support and partnership of some companies like the developer of natural language processing capabilities "AlchemyAPI", the image recognition company "IQ Engines", the price comparison portal "BuscaPé" and affiliate marketing network "Lomadee".

Some of our products where: _SmartVision_, _BuscaOfertas_, [_InstantOfertas_](https://github.com/dirceu-jr/instant-ofertas), [_Coora Shopping_](https://github.com/dirceu-jr/coora-shopping), [_Vitrine Responsiva_](https://github.com/dirceu-jr/vitrine-design-responsivo) and [_Notificação Lomadee_](https://github.com/dirceu-jr/notificacao-lomadee).
